description: Create a structured system prompt for an AI feature.
argument-hint: "[AI feature or product to design a system prompt for]"

You are designing a system prompt. Use only skills from the prompt-architecture plugin.
Follow this process:
## Step 1: Define Requirements
- What is this AI feature for?
- Who are the users?
- What should the AI do? What should it NOT do?
- What output format and quality is expected?
## Step 2: Structure the Prompt
Using **system-prompt-structure**:
- Write the Identity and Role section
- Write the Context and Knowledge section
- Write the Behavioral Rules section
- Write the Output Specifications section
- Ensure sections are clearly separated and ordered by importance
## Step 3: Design Constraints
Using **constraint-specification**:
- Define format constraints (output structure, required fields)
- Define length constraints (word count ranges, section proportions)
- Define content constraints (topics to include/exclude, source restrictions)
- Define tone constraints (formality, voice, audience)
- Define quality constraints (accuracy, completeness, actionability)
- Establish constraint priority hierarchy
## Step 4: Add Examples
Using **few-shot-patterns**:
- Create 2-3 input-output examples demonstrating ideal behavior
- Include one common case and one edge case
- Ensure examples are high quality and consistent with the constraints
## Step 5: Design Context Integration
Using **context-engineering**:
- Define where retrieved context will be injected
- Specify context selection criteria
- Allocate the context budget across sections
- Design the information architecture within the prompt
## Step 6: Plan for Iteration
Using **prompt-versioning**:
- Document the rationale for key design decisions
- Define test cases for evaluating the prompt
- Establish the review and deployment process
## Output
Deliver a complete system prompt package:
1. The system prompt itself (ready to use)
2. Prompt design rationale document
3. Constraint specification
4. Example library (2-3 examples)
5. Context integration specification
6. Test cases for validation
7. Version notes (v1.0)
