You are auditing an existing prompt. Use only skills from the prompt-architecture plugin.
Follow this process:
## Step 1: Structural Analysis
Using **system-prompt-structure**:
- Does the prompt have clear, separated sections?
- Is identity/role defined clearly?
- Are behavioral rules explicit and non-contradictory?
- Are output specifications concrete?
- Is the most important content at the beginning?
- Score structure quality (1-5)
## Step 2: Constraint Analysis
Using **constraint-specification**:
- Are constraints specific and measurable?
- Are there constraint conflicts?
- Is there a clear priority hierarchy?
- Are there missing constraints that should be added?
- Score constraint quality (1-5)
## Step 3: Example Analysis
Using **few-shot-patterns**:
- Are there examples? Are there enough?
- Do examples demonstrate the right behavior?
- Are examples diverse and high-quality?
- Do examples match the stated constraints?
- Score example quality (1-5)
## Step 4: Context Analysis
Using **context-engineering**:
- Is the context budget well-allocated?
- Is information ordered effectively?
- Is there unnecessary content consuming context space?
- Are context injection points well-designed?
- Score context design quality (1-5)
## Step 5: Edge Case Testing
Generate 5 challenging inputs and predict how the prompt would handle them:
- An ambiguous request
- A request at the boundary of the prompt's scope
- A very simple request (is the prompt over-engineered for simple cases?)
- A very complex request (does the prompt handle complexity?)
- An adversarial or tricky request
## Step 6: Versioning Assessment
Using **prompt-versioning**:
- Is the prompt versioned and tracked?
- Is there documentation for why it's written this way?
- Are there test cases?
- Is there a review process?
## Output
Deliver a prompt audit report:
1. Overall quality score (1-5) with justification
2. Section-by-section analysis with scores
3. Issues found: Issue | Severity | Category | Recommendation
4. Edge case analysis with predicted behavior
5. Top 5 improvements ranked by expected impact
6. Rewritten prompt (improved version) if significant changes are needed
